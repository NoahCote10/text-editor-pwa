## Description <a name="description"></a>
This project was to turn an existing application into a PWA. This involved adding webpack plugins, creating a service worker, and bundling the app into a folder for installation onto the user's computer. I also had to create GET and PUT requests to update the saved information.
## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
To install go to [this link](https://shielded-refuge-41265.herokuapp.com/). From there you can access the web version of this app. You can also press the install button in the top left corner or the install button ![install-button][installButton] to the right of the url bar.
